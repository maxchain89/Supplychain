Hello! This is my first react.js / solidity smart contract! Please feel free to play around with it. You've got your basic CRUD, you can add update and delte items. As well as a few other details you can change. The idea behind this app is to show case how we can use block chains to store our data for our supply chains and how much more secure this can be. 
BE SURE AND ONLY USE TEST ETH FOR THIS APP!!! You'll need to connect you meta mask with an account with test eth first and then when you make any changes it takes just a few seconds for the udpate to show. Please let me know what you think!
