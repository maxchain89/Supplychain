# Supply Chain on Blockchain

Hello! This is my first React.js/Solidity smart contract project. The idea behind this app is to showcase how blockchains can be used to store data for supply chains and how much more secure this can be. You've got your basic CRUD operations where you can add, update, and delete items, along with a few other details you can change.

Feel free to play around with it, but **BE SURE TO ONLY USE TEST ETH FOR THIS APP**!

## Features

- **Create**: Add new items to the supply chain.
- **Read**: View details of existing items.
- **Update**: Change details of the items.
- **Delete**: Remove items from the supply chain.
- **Secure**: All data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring integrity and security.
